Here is the library directory.
You can put your process-flow libraries.

Store your files inside folders and name them using the following convention:
* foo.service.js --> Service class that define the service behaviours
* foo.model.js --> Model class related to DB processes
* foo.schema.js --> Schema class/object related to a validation schema
