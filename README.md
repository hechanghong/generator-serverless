# Generator Serverless
Yeoman generator for a lambda Serverless project

## Requirements

* Node V6.x
* Yeoman >= V1.8.5

## Generator installation

First of all, you are going to need [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/):
```
npm install -g yo
```
Then get the generator:

```bash
npm i -g generator-serverless
```

## Usage

### Base generator

Once the link established, you can use it right away.
Create a new directory where you want your project to be and run it:
```
mkdir my-awesome-lambda
cd my-awesome-lambda
yo serverless
```
It will prompt some questions you need to answer to configure your project.
Default values are specified between parenthesis.
You now have a starter skeleton for a lambda project!

### Sub-generator

While working on your project, you can easily add a function/route by using the subgenerator.
In the root directory of your project, type:
```
yo serverless:route
```
Just like the base generator, it will prompt you to give the function(s) name(s).
It creates the handler files
 and modify the `serverless.yml` file according to.
